## Project: KanBug Tracker

### Overview

This portfolio page highlights my contributions to KanBug Tracker - a Software Engineering project developed as part of the module CS2103T during my second year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore. 

### About the Team

We are five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates reading CS2103T: Software Engineering. 

### About the project

KanBug Tracker is a lightweight, easy to use bug management tool that aims to empower developers to keep better track of the bugs in their projects. It provides users not only with a convenient way to record their bugs, but also allows them to better coordinate their efforts between various bugs and track the state of each bug throughout its lifecycle. The team has also developed various other user-centric features to provide our users with the functionality they need to empower their bug tracking efforts. 

## Summary of contributions  

* **New Feature**: I implemented the ability to search bugs based on the given query-string via `search` command.  
  
  * What it does: The feature provides the user with the ability to sort out a list of bugs that contain your given input. 
  * Justification: This feature improves Kanbug Tracker remarkably since the users now have a direct and fast method to find out a particular bug. Without this feature, users might have to manually find out the bug among a very long list of existing bugs, which is very time-consuming. Therefore, this saves the users invaluable time, helping them to enhance the efficiency and productivity.   
  
* **New Feature**: I partially implemented the ability to move a bug to another state via `move` command.

  * What it does: The feature provides the user with the ability to move a particular bug from the current state to a new state.  
  * Justification: This feature helps users significantly regarding the process of managing a huge list of bugs. Without this feature, it is cumbersome to categorize each bug in term of its state of progress during each stage of software development. This helps the users to gain high efficiency in the process of tracking bugs.  

* **Code contributed**: You can view my functional code and test code contributions to KanBug Tracker [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=duynguyen24501&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Other contributions:**

    * **Enhancements to existing features**:
         * Separate the code implementations between Kanban board view and List view.  
         * Improve the Ui visuals of Kanban board view.  
         
    * **Project management**:
         * As in-charge of Scheduling and Tracking, I set up four milestones with appropriate delivery for each, created required labels/tags, monitored to create and assign Github issues to relevant members. Additionally, I ensured that no issues are expired in a specified milestone. To achieve this, I would inform my teammates when they had not finished the assigned tasks right after the internal deadline.  
         * Ensured that every member of the team has completed their weekly tasks that involves Github issues on the CS2103T website before the deadline. 
         * Contributed implementation ideas/alternatives, brainstorming user stories for multiple main features of the application.
         
    * **Documentation**:
         * Wrote the sections for `search` and `clear` commands in KanBug Tracker's User Guide.
         * Wrote the section for `search` command in KanBug Tracker's Developer Guide.
